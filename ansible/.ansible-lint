# Ansible Lint Configuration for Personal Dotfiles
# Focus: Catch bugs, not enforce corporate style guides

# Skip rules that are too strict for personal projects
skip_list:
  - var-naming[no-role-prefix]  # Don't need role prefixes in personal repo
  - name[casing]                # Allow flexible task naming
  - ignore-errors               # Sometimes you really do want to ignore errors
  - yaml[line-length]           # Don't enforce line length limits
  - no-handler                  # Using 'when: changed' is fine for simple playbooks

# Warn instead of fail for these
warn_list:
  - experimental                # Warn about experimental features
  - no-changed-when             # Helpful but not critical

# Enable offline mode to avoid checking for unknown modules
# (assumes you know your requirements.yml is correct)
offline: false

# Exclude certain paths
exclude_paths:
  - .github/
  - .git/
  - venv/
